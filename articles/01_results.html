<p>The swift CC894 is assumed to be at least one year old, but
sub-adult, as it did not find a nesting spot during the logging period.
Swift CC894 returned to the colony and briefly was established in a nest
box (camera box 2) around the 25th of May 2023, as visually confirmed by
video feed and sexed as female (copulation, egg laying), before
subsequent logger retrieval. The logger on swift CC894 telemetry showed
that logging started on the preset start date (2021-07-10) and the
battery remained functional and holding charge until retrieval
(2023-06-11), running ~25 months, yet exhausting the logger memory for
both light level and ancillary measurements. Light and pressure data did
not suggest roosting at a nest (box) during the day or night, showing
vastly insufficient roosting opportunities to foster a brood. Across the
whole logging period only a total of ~48 hours scattered across the
whole logging period of &gt;12 000 hours are flagged as potentially
inactive, this in contrast to well defined inactive roosting periods for
breeding adult swifts (Appendix Figure S1).</p>
<p>Swift CC894 followed a similar flight patterns to adults in the
colony when migrating to foraging sites in Eastern Africa, passing
briefly through Western Africa and skirting the gulf of Guinea to pass
south of the Congo Basin to the coastline of Malawi and Mozambique
(Figure 1a, Hufkens et al. 2023). During this trip the swift made
several stop-overs. Stop-overs were more common in Eastern Africa than
those in Western Africa. Average distances between the sub-adult and
adult stop-overs registered to be in the low hundreds of kilometers (303
± 108 km). Swift CC894 showed great site fidelity between the two
observed years, returning to within a hundred kilometres (~129 km) from
previously visited final (furthest) foraging locations in eastern
Mozambique, year-on-year (see Figure 1a).</p>
<p>A comparison of diurnal flight behaviour during the non-breeding and
breeding season showed distinct differences (Figure 1b). During the
non-breeding season differences in average daily flight altitude or
flight heights are limited. However, during the breeding season twilight
flights remain present but are lower in absolute altitude (i.e. due to
the terrain) but higher in flight height (i.e. due to a larger diurnal
change) than during the non-breeding season. We also note the lower
altitudes during daytime for sub-adults than adults (Appendix Figure
S3). In short, during the day non-breeding season flights are higher in
baseline altitude than those during the breeding season for sub-adults
(Appendix Figure S2), while roosting behaviour in adult birds (see
Appendix Figure S1) is shown by negative flight heights.</p>
<p>During the non-breeding season the sub-adult swift followed the
established diurnal pattern of moonlight induced flight height changes
of adults, with high flights in response to moonlit night times (Figure
1b). Increased flight heights were recorded in response to sky
brightness values as low as 0.02 - 0.05 lux, translating to a modelled
flight height of ~850 m (Figure 2c, with C = 854 (17 Std. Error), k =
-65 (5 Std. Error)). Moonlight-driven flight patterns were not observed
in sub-adults during the breeding season, with no characteristic
asymmetry in flight height, following the moon phases, as observed
during the non-breeding season (Figure 1b).</p>
<p>We note that during the breeding season swifts residing around Ghent,
Belgium, are exposed to high sky glow values of up to ~0.12 lux (Figure
2d). Night sky brightness data (Falchi et al. 2016) show 31% of the
values during the breeding season exceeding the 0.1 lux on cloudy
nights, as 55% of the time the mean nighttime cloud cover exceeded 50%
(Figure 2d). During ambient illuminance values exceeding ~0.1 lux will
trigger a maximum flight height response during moonlit nights (Figure
2b). As such, maximum flight heights under extensive Belgian sky glow
(Appendix Figure S3) show correspondence to moonlight responses (Figure
2c). A comparative analysis for a location in Southern Sweden (Lund)
during the non-breeding season did not allow us to differentiate
sub-adult flight behaviour based on previous radar studies. Although at
Lund light pollution and sky glow is lower (at ~0.009 lux and ~0.098
lux, respectively) and high latitude summer nights are brighter with
most only reaching nautically twilight with illuminance values varying
from 0.008 lux to 2 (Appendix Figure S4). Illuminance values exceeding
0.01 lux are sufficient to trigger an ascending flight, when based on
moonlight behaviour during the non-breeding season (Figure 2b).</p>
